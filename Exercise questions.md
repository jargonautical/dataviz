#Exercise questions

The clinics.csv dataset contains a list of premises with address information, geograpical data and a few other attributes. You can take a look at the data to get an idea of what it contains and how it's arranged.

Your task is to present the data in a way that answers one of these three questions:
 - how many clinics have a website?
 - which places have the most clinics?
 - where are the clusters and where are the gaps?
 
If you think of another question that we could ask of this data, feel free to tackle that instead. 
 
#####Exercise 1
No software allowed! Before you get on to manipulating the data itself, use the pens and paper to roughly sketch what you think a good data presentation should be.
 
#####Exercise 2
Choose a software tool you like using, or one that you want to try today, and use it to create a data visualisation folowing the principles we've just covered.
 
####TIP - all the slides are in this folder as well if you want to go back and look.
